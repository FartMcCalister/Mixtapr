Optimize Cassette Mixtapes

This tool optimizes the layout of tracks on a cassette mixtape to maximze the usage of available tape.

How To Use:
1. Upload tracks
2. Select tape settings
3. OPTIMIZE!
4. Play

Some tape decks have a "skip track" function. This moves the tape until the deck detects a section of blank space, then plays from there. If your deck has this feature, you can add blank space between the tracks.


Uses audio-metadata JS library from tmont: https://github.com/tmont/audio-metadata
